# indicators-demo
A repo showing some of the non-IP-sensitive work I completed on a client project

Note this has not been accurately reconstructed and the names of some classes and key logic has been changed, and will not be functional as there will be many missing Classes. 
The Classes and logic contained in the repo is to demonstrate some of the code I have written and my code styling. 

Majority of the code written here is written exclusively by me, with a few exceptions and notes around that: 
- The OrganisationController was inherited in quite a bad state, and I made efforts to do a minor refactor. There is too much being handled by Inertia and being passes through the Home component, and it is in my opinion not good practice or code that I would be proud to associate myself with. A majority of the code should be refactored into API's which are then called from the sub-dashboards of the Home page.
- The indicator verification and indicator submission filament resources were written by colleague, and there are number of things I would prefer to change about those. 
-


- There are many complexities in this part of the application, which the client was advised against, but insisted upon.
